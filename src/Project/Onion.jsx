        Red onions require at least one inch of water each week. If it doesn't
        rain, give your plants a good soaking once per week, twice in very hot,
        dry conditions. An inch of rain should soak sandy, well-drained soil to
        a depth of ten inches and heavier clay soil six inches deep. Check the
        soil moisture with a trowel and add more water as needed. Sandy soil may
        need more frequent watering. Stop watering when the onion leaves start
        to fall over.

        Onions are a cool-season crop that grows best in temperatures between 55
        and 75 degrees F., but they can withstand a light frost. Hard freezes
        below 20 degrees F. can damage plants. Watering well before a hard
        freeze and protecting plants with mulch can help insulate them from
        damage.
